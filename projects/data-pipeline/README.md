### Overview

This is still very, very much work in progress :D
Thank you for taking the time to go through this.

Current modules go in this direction:
- extractor -> main
- checker -> main
- writer -> main
- curator -> main
- settings -> main
- params -> extractor, checker, writer, reader, main

Thank you
Nicola
