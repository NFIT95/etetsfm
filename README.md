# Practice end-to-end app for time-series forecassting

## Overview

Hey hi all :D
This is still very, very much work in progress :D
Thank you for taking the time to go through this.

The idea is creating all the apps on-prem, and then moving them to an Azure environment.
Containerization is not yet part of this project.

Currently only some modules in projects/data-pipeline/data_pipeline are written.
To know more please have a look at projects/data-pipeline/README.md

Thank you
Nicola
